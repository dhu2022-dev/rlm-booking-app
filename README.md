## Starting the Site Locally (React + Django):
1. Ensure you have django installed in your python environment
2. cd into /frontend folder within RLM-booking and then run ```npm install```
3. Decide if you want to run the React frontend in production environment, or for development
4. If for production: run ```npm run build``` in the frontend folder. This builds the React site.
5. If for development: run ```npm start``` if you want to see instant changes in React. This can be accessed at localhost:3000
    a. If you are planning on testing api calls on this test frontend server, you must create a .env in the frontend with the following:
    ```REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL_AR=http://localhost:8000/artist_recommendation```
    ```REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL_EM=http://localhost:8000/event_management```

6. Run ```python manage.py runserver``` in the RLM-Booking folder. This hosts the backend at localhost:8000 (allows api requests)
